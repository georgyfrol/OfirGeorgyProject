What has roots as nobody sees,\n                    Is taller than trees,\n                    Up, up it goes,\n                    And yet never grows?
mountain
Alive without breath,\n                    As cold as death;\n                    Never thirsty, ever drinking,\n                    All in mail never clinking
fish
What has keys but can't open locks?
piano
I speak without a mouth. What am I?
