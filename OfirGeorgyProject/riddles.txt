What has roots as nobody sees,\n                    Is taller than trees,\n                    Up, up it goes,\n                    And yet never grows?
mountain
Alive without breath,\n                    As cold as death;\n                    Never thirsty, ever drinking,\n                    All in mail never clinking
fish
What has keys but can't open locks?
piano
I speak without a mouth. What am I?
echo
If you drop me I crack,\n                    But smile at me and I smile back.
mirror
What runs but never walks,\n                    Murmurs but never talks?
river
The more of this there is,\n                    The less you see.
darkness
I'm tall when I'm young,\n                    And I'm short when I'm old.
candle
What has a head and a tail\n                    But no body?
coin
What belongs to you,\n                    But others use it more than you?
